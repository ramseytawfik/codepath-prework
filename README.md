## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission
(be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
```

Overall, I thought that the prework was simple and easy to follow along with. I only experienced a couple of syntaxes when completing the game. It was usually that I had capitalized a letter or forgot to add a bracket, which was a quick fix. I only thought that there were two parts that were kind of hard. The first one is that I had a little trouble coding the part where the computer had to display the pattern before the user followed after. I spent a little time on it, but in the end, figured it out. The other part that was a little bit harder is that after I finished the game, I went back and experimented with the parts in the code. I spent about 2/3 hours completing the game, then spent the remaining time really trying to understand every feature that we implemented into the game so far. After going back and adding more features, I realized how more difficult some of the features were. I had begun to work on the part where the user had a limited time to follow the pattern. After completing that part, I was very relieved, but then realized that I had messed up something in the part that randomly chose the pattern before playing. This made me very cautious about messing up parts that I had already completed and to stay more organized. I had also spent about two hours trying to get a trumpet audio as the frequency. I kept reading online and i felt that I had finally got it. The keys were playing the trumpet sounds in harmony and it kind of worked on one of the keys. When I went back to complete the rest of the keys, they had just stopped working all together. I believe I didn’t link the audio correctly for the function to be able to produce the sound on the computers end and the users end. It was very frustrating, but it taught me how to keep looking for the answer and to keep trying, even if you don’t find the right answer.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing
your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
```

I am curious about how to keep your code more organized during the process of creating a game. I am usually used to just coding with one language at a time, rather than HTML, .js, and CSS all at one time. On my end, I had an error for the changes in the color and it took me about 5-10 minutes to figure it out. If the code was 1000+ lines, I would have taken way longer than that. Is there a technique in the way you can format your code when using multiple languages so that you can find bugs or errors quicker? In addition to that, If I were working with a team on a project, how would I be able to plan out with them certain parts so that we all don’t have to be working on it at the same time. For example, If I were making a feature in the index.html, but my groupmate was styling it or programming it in the script.js and style.css, how could they work on their part, if for instance, I hadn’t started that part yet.

```
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them
doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc).
Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
```

1. I would want to first off try and condense the code down a little bit more and make it more readable. This would mean adding more comments and naming the variables more specifically so that it is easier to understand. I think that the game would run faster and be able to interpret better if there were fewer lines of code.

2. Second off, I would maybe add a leaderboard where you can add your name and the score so that you can compare your score to other players that are playing. This would require cookies and some backend work as well.

3. I would also like to implement a feature to enlarge the buttons for the user, in case someone is using a mobile device and the buttons are too big or too small.

4. I would also make it so that the user can earn coins and be able to open up a shop and use the shop to buy things like different music, colors, and sounds. This would make the game more enjoyable and create an incentive to continue playing the game.

5. I would also have a mute button on the game. Sometimes you are playing the game and you want to mute it so that it isn’t playing out loud, so that would be a useful feature to add.

6. Lastly, I would integrate an option where the notes that you play, end up playing the sequence of an actual song, which the user can either choose at the beginning or buy in the shop.
